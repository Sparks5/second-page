      <p>My home makes me feel safe and thorugh this it is my favorite place. I' not going to talk about my favorite movie, since i dont have one. Back to the favorite place. I like my home a lot it makes me feel comphy and it nurtures me from a old feeling of a place that i love and a place that everyone comes back to.
